# üü¢ OM1 + Smart Assistant + Wallet Payments  

This project integrates **OM1** with a **Smart Assistant** (e.g., Alexa, Siri, Home Assistant) to help users place orders or trigger actions, with payments securely processed via a connected crypto wallet (e.g., Coinbase).  

It demonstrates how AI assistants can interact with blockchain wallets for **autonomous, secure, and transparent payments**.  

---

## ‚ú® Features  

- **Smart Assistant Integration**  
  - OM1 communicates with a smart assistant to place orders or trigger actions.  

- **Wallet-Based Payments**  
  - Payments are executed securely via a connected crypto wallet.  
  - Transaction status (**success, pending, failed**) is reported back to the user.  

- **End-to-End Workflow**  
  1. User requests order via smart assistant.  
  2. OM1 communicates with the assistant.  
  3. Payment is processed via wallet.  
  4. Confirmation is received and reported back.  

# OM1 Smart Assistant Wallet

This repository contains the backend implementation for the OM1 Smart Assistant Wallet, a proof-of-concept that integrates voice commands with on-chain cryptocurrency transactions. It demonstrates how a decentralized security monitoring engine can be used for real-time payments initiated through a simple conversational interface.

---

## üí° Example Workflow

The core function of this project is to link a voice command to an on-chain transaction.

1.  **User Request:** A user issues a voice command, e.g., "Hey Alexa, order me a coffee."
2.  **Assistant & OM1:** The Smart Assistant receives the request, relays it to the Express server, which then interfaces with the OM1 API.
3.  **Payment Initiation:** A crypto payment is initiated from the configured testnet wallet to the Merchant's address.
4.  **Status Return:** The transaction status (`‚úÖ success / ‚è≥ pending / ‚ùå failed`) is returned to the user via the Smart Assistant.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

To get the server up and running, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone the project:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/om1-smart-assistant-wallet.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/om1-smart-assistant-wallet.git)
cd om1-smart-assistant-wallet
````

### 2\. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3\. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. This file holds your sensitive credentials and configuration settings.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Note:**

  * **DO NOT** commit your `.env` file to GitHub.
  * **DO NOT** use a private key for a wallet holding real assets. **Use ONLY testnet credentials.**

The `.env` file must contain the following variables:

```ini
PORT=3000
OM1_API_URL=[https://api.om1.example](https://api.om1.example)
OM1_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
RPC_URL=[https://rpc.sepolia.org](https://rpc.sepolia.org)         # Your Ethereum Testnet RPC endpoint
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY     # Use ONLY a testnet wallet key
MERCHANT_ADDRESS=0xMERCHANT_TEST_ADDR   # Testnet wallet address that receives payments
```

## üöÄ Run the Server

Start the Express server using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

If the setup is successful, you will see a confirmation message in the terminal:

```
[dotenv@17.2.2] injecting env (6) from .env
üöÄ Server running on http://localhost:3000
```
